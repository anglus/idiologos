You will remember from our consideration of C-14 dating that radiometric dating uses the known rate of decay of radioactive isotopes to date an object. Each radioactive isotope has a known, fixed rate of decay.\r\nNow, when you form this list, don’t be legalistic. Don’t sit someone down on the first date and interview them to make sure they meet all of the qualities. That’s freakish, weirdo stuff. Again, don’t give the rest of us bad name. Your list is designed to give you a framework for dating, not be a checklist for it.\r\nI dated a man who was after me for four years at my job. When I first went out with him he never told me that he was still married but seperated. Then after 3 months we became intimate and then a mutual friend who saw us at the car wash said to him, \"hey you still with so and so. He said no! Later he told me he was separated and even showed me the divorce papers. I am now into the relationship one and half years and I am not happy that he is not legally divorced. He tells me over and over that he is only with his x for financial reasons and that he does not want to hurt his children. Each time I try to break up he gets extremely hurt and doesn't want to let me go. I am fifty years old and he is 45. I know I have to leave this situation but how can I do it without him hating me, etc. I told him I can't go on with a legally married man even though he has been separted for 12 years. Prior to me he has had 4 steady girlfriends and never left his x. He is always with me or his children and I know he is not itimate with her. He shows me so much love and we get along and travel, but this is too hard. I know I am fifty years old, but I would like to get married one day. I don't like the dating scene.
