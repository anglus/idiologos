message: "I think that what you posted made a lot of sense. But, \r\nthink on this, suppose you typed a catchier post title?\r\n\r\nI mean, I don't wish to tell you how to run your blog, but \r\nsuppose you added something that grabbed people's attention? I mean Jekyll and Staticman is kinda plain. You ought to peek at Yahoo's home page and watch how they create \r\npost titles to get people to open the links.\r\nYou might try adding a video or a related pic or two to grab people \r\nexcited about everything've got to say. In my opinion, it would make \r\nyour blog a little bit more interesting."
